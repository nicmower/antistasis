# ANTISTASIS
an amateur game that likely will not be finished any time in the near future

# OBJECTIVE
This game aims to be closer to a simulation than a traditional game, exploring the intersection of climate, nature, and human civilization.
The ultimate goal will be gameplay where the player can take the role of either nature or humanity, and either destroy the other or learn to coexist.
If the player aims to lead humanity towards equilibrium with nature, it will be necessary to maintain the stability of society through human well-being.

# CURRENT STATE
12/19/2024:
Using Python/Pygame, the current game is a map generator and a barely-functioning, inefficient simulation of heat transfer.
The near-term goal is to move to Pyglet and improve code efficiency and readability. 
The mid-term goal is to have *at least* the climate simulation layer functioning as well as it can, identifying the capabilities of the simulation (i.e. world size).
The long-term goal is to move to another language entirely, refactoring the code to work in a better environment like Unity or Godot.
